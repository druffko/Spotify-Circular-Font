# Spotify Circular (LL Circular)
LL Circular is a geometric sans-serif font family in eight weights. It is Laurenz Brunner’s second official release after the critically acclaimed, immensely popular LL Akkurat.

LL Circular offers a fresh take on the genre of the geometric grotesk. This typographic current was prevalent in pre-war Germany, exemplified by Jakob Erbar’s Erbar Grotesk (1926–29), Paul Renner’s Futura (1927–28), Rudolf Koch's Kabel (1927–29) and Wilhelm Pischner’s Neuzeit Grotesk (1928–29). It later found prominent re-visitations in the 1970s with Herb Lubalin’s Avant Garde and in the 1980s with Adrian Frutiger’s Avenir.

First begun in 2008, LL Circular’s design evolved from a purely geometric approach to a more complex formal conception by the time of its 2013 release. The result is a geometric sans serif that marries purity with warmth and strikes a balance between functionality, conceptual rigour, skilled workmanship and measured idiosyncrasy. With both unmistakeable character and near-universal appeal, this friendly font proved popular in editorial, advertising or branding contexts. It lends itself beautifully for use in headlines or for body copy.
